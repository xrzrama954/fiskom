a = [0:0.5:5];
b = 2*a.^2 + 3*a -5;
plot(a,b)
%Remarks:
%(1) In "plot(a,b)", the array "a" should contain the data of the coordinate or "grid point)
%on the x-axis and "b" should be the corresponding values on the y-axis.
%(2) After a plot is made, it can be further modified by using the interactive tool for
%graphics. For example, the labels of the x and y axes can be manually added to the plot.
%(3) The plot can be saved in various formats (jpg, tif, eps, etc.).
