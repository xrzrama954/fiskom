a = [2 3 5];
b = [2 4 9];
c = a.*b
%Remark: The period preceding the mathematical operation, "*", indicates that the
%operation will be performed element-by-element. In this case, the content of c is
%c = [a(1)*b(1) a(2)*b(2) a(3)*b(3)]
%Also, c is automatically assigned as a 1-D array with 3 element
