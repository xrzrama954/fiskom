a = 3;
b = 12;
c = (2*a+b^2-a*b+b/a-10)/2
%Remark: The right hand side of the third statement includes all 4 of the basic arithmetic operators, + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division), in their usual meaning. It also includes the symbol, ^, which means "to the power of", so "b^2" means (the content of b) to the power of 2, i.e., 92  = 81. The right hand side of that statement is first evaluated: r.h.s. = 2 x 3 + 92 - 3 x 9 + 9/3 - 10 = 53. The content of r.h.s., now 53, is then assigned to the variable c in the left hand side. Since this statement is not followed by a semicolon, the content of c is dumped as the final output.
